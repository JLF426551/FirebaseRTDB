# FirebaseRTDB
An introductory example to Firebase Real Time Database

Firebase Real Time Database In Android
Getting Started Guide on Reading and Writing Data.

Requires basic introduction knowledge of the Firebase Real Time Database. In particular, assumes you have completed all steps up to “Write to your Database.”

Getting Started: 
https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/start/

Read how data is stored:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/structure-data

I recommend you watch this as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpFDFK44pX8 

The reason I created this entry is that there is almost no information on how to manipulate or create information on your database. In order to continue, you will need to obtain your own JSON file by adding a project to your Firebase Console.
